Everything you need to know about the “mouth harp” and how to choose the right one(s) to match your music and ambitions.

When it comes to easy playability, affordability and portability, it’s hard to beat a harmonica. Despite their modest size and cost, harmonicas are capable of producing an amazing array of tones, and this versatility is reflected in the music genres in which the mighty little mouth harp plays a part. From the more obvious categories such as blues, country, and rock to more surprising musical territory such as jazz and classical music, the harmonica with its often human-like voice easily fits in.

In this guide, we’ll look at the many types of harmonicas that are available and pinpoint those that make sense for beginners as well as harp players and other musicians looking to expand their repertoires.

一切你需要知道的“竖琴”和如何选择正确的一个（s），以匹配你的音乐和野心。

当谈到容易的可玩性，可负担性和便携性，很难击败口琴。 尽管它们尺寸和成本适中，但是和声能够产生惊人的音色阵列，这种多功能性反映在强大的小嘴琴竖琴发挥作用的音乐流派中。 从更加明显的类别，如蓝调，乡村和摇滚到更令人惊讶的音乐领域，如爵士和古典音乐，口琴与其经常类似人的声音很容易适应。

在本指南中，我们将看到许多类型的和声，并且精确定位那些对初学者以及竖琴演奏者和其他音乐家寻找扩展他们的曲目有意义。


Types of harmonicas

Though there are a number of specialty harmonicas, the three most common varieties fall into one of three categories based on how they are tuned: diatonic, chromatic, and tremolo. We’ll focus mainly on these while touching on a few of the less common harmonica types.

If you want to dive right in, you can browse the huge Musician’s Friend selection of all types of harmonicas here.

Diatonic harmonicas

The most common type of harmonica you’ll encounter in pop, blues and folk music—diatonic harmonicas are designed to play in a specific key. That said, overblowing and note-bending techniques plus playing in alternate “positions” makes it possible to play a diatonic in keys and modes other than its “official” key. A couple of players, Howard Levy and Carlos Del Junco, have developed an overblowing technique with which they play chromatically using a humble 10-hole diatonic harp.

Blues harp players usually perform in what’s called “cross harp” or “second position.” This involves playing a harmonica that’s tuned to a perfect fourth below the key the music’s written in. If a song is in the key of C, a G harmonica will be used. Most blues use the notes of a pentatonic scale, and playing a G-tuned harp gives you access to notes that complement the pentatonic C scale, especially on draw notes—those on which you inhale to produce those wailing “bent” notes that are a cornerstone of blues harp technique.

There are a number of other positions that skilled harp players use to mesh with other instruments and create various effects. Cupping your hands around the harp and using your tongue to block and unblock holes are some of the ways to create rhythmic chordal effects and tones. You’ll find numerous online resources as well as harmonica books and tutorials that explain these techniques in detail. We’ll make several recommendations on excellent harp tutorials below.

A diatonic harmonica’s simplicity makes it a great choice for the beginner. Most harmonica teachers recommend starting out with a 10-hole diatonic harmonica tuned to the key of C.

谐波的类型

虽然有一些专业的和声，三个最常见的品种根据如何调整分为三个类别之一：全音阶，色调和颤音。我们将主要集中在这些，同时触及一些不常见的口琴类型。

如果你想潜水，你可以浏览巨大的音乐家的朋友选择所有类型的和声在这里。

全息谐波

在流行音乐，蓝调和民谣音乐 - 全音阶中，你会遇到的最常见的口琴类型是专门用于演奏特定琴键。也就是说，超吹和音符弯曲技术加上在交替“位置”播放使得可以在除了其“官方”键之外的键和模式中播放全音阶。几个球员，霍华德Levy和卡洛斯德尔Junco，已经开发了一种overblowing技术，他们使用一个谦逊的10洞全音乐竖琴演奏。

蓝调竖琴球员通常在所谓的“交叉竖琴”或“第二位置”中演奏。这涉及到演奏口琴，该琴弦调整到音乐写入的琴键下面的完美的四分之一。如果一首歌曲在C的琴键中，将会被使用。大多数蓝调使用五音阶音符，而演奏G调音竖琴可让您获得补充五音C音阶的音符，特别是在绘制音符上，您吸气时产生的那些“弯曲”音符是蓝调竖琴技术的基石。

还有一些其他的位置，熟练的竖琴球员用来与其他乐器网格和创建各种效果。把你的手围在竖琴上，用你的舌头阻挡和打开洞是一些创造节奏的弦效果和音调的方法。你会发现许多在线资源，以及口琴书籍和教程，详细解释这些技术。我们将在以下关于优秀竖琴教程的几个建议。

全音阶口琴的简单性使其成为初学者的绝佳选择。大多数口琴教师建议开始用一个10孔全音调口琴调到C键。


As you shop the huge selection of harmonicas at Musician's Friend, you’ll come across many variations on the basic diatonic harmonica.Take for example the Lee Oskar line of harmonicas. Designed by the harp player who gave the band War its distinctive sound, some Lee Oskar models are tuned to minor and other non-standard scales. Many harp players like their bright, penetrating sound and the fact the company sells replacement reed plates so you can refurbish an older harp rather than buying a new one.

当你在音乐家的朋友购买大量的选集，你会遇到许多变化的基本全音调口琴。例如李奥斯卡线谐波。 由竖琴家设计的乐队战争的独特的声音，一些李奥斯卡模型调整为小和其他非标准的尺度。 许多竖琴球员喜欢他们明亮，穿透的声音和事实，该公司卖替换芦苇板，所以你可以翻新旧的竖琴，而不是买一个新的。

Most harp players end up with a collection of diatonic harmonicas from various makers in a range of keys. Since their cost is far more modest than say, guitars, building a collection of harps to suit various styles of music and situations is easy to do. We recommend you try a number of different models to discover which instruments suit your playing style and the sound you’re going for.

Chromatic harmonicas

Most chromatic harmonicas have a button-activated lever that directs air to two separate reed plates that include all the notes in the 12-tone western scale. With sufficient skill, you can play just about any scale or mode using the chromatic’s “gear shift.”

The larger reeds in the chromatic are somewhat harder to bend and overblow than their diatonic counterparts. But thanks to their heft, the chromatic is capable of producing some very rich-sounding chords and effects. Many blues harp players such as Little Walter, Rod Piazza and George “Harmonica” Smith have used chromatics to generate fat tones that have led to the blues fan term “Mississippi saxophone.”

In the hands of a virtuoso like Toots Thielman, a chromatic harmonica can be used to play complex jazz scales with lightning-fast melodic runs that you’d more likely associate with a saxophone. Stevie Wonder is another master of the chromatic harmonica. His harp solos on “Isn’t She Lovely” offer a master class in overblowing techniques.

Chromatic harmonicas are more difficult to play than diatonics. Therefore, we recommend beginning with a diatonic and stepping up when you’re ready to take on a more challenging instrument. Learning to first play in all positions on a diatonic will allow you to graduate more easily to a chromatic. Even though chromatics are nominally tuned to the key of C or G, in actuality, if you learn all the appropriate scales and positions, you can play virtually any music that uses the standard 12-tone scale.

大多数竖琴演奏者最终得到了来自各种制造商的一系列全音阶的全音阶。由于他们的成本远远低于说，吉他，建立一个竖琴的集合，以适应各种风格的音乐和情况很容易做到。我们建议您尝试一些不同的型号，以发现哪些乐器适合你的演奏风格和你要去的声音。

色调

大多数色调有一个按钮激活的杠杆，将空气导向两个单独的芦苇板，包括12音西方音阶的所有音符。有足够的技能，你可以玩任何比例或模式使用色彩的“换档”。

较大的芦苇比起全音阶对比，有点难以弯曲和超支。但由于他们的重任，色彩能够产生一些非常丰富的和弦和效果。许多蓝调竖琴的球员，如小沃尔特，杆广场和乔治“口琴”史密斯已经使用色度生成脂肪色调，导致蓝调风扇术语“密西西比萨克斯管”。

在像Toots Thielman这样的演奏家手中，一个色调可以用来演奏复杂的爵士音阶与闪电般快速的旋律运行，你更可能与一个萨克斯管。 Stevie Wonder是另一个高级口琴的大师。他的竖琴独奏“不是她可爱”提供了一个超级技巧的大师班。

色调比diaton更难玩。因此，我们建议先从全音阶开始，然后在准备好接受更具挑战性的乐器时加快。学习先在全音阶的所有位置玩，这将允许你更容易地毕业到有色。即使色度名称上调整到C或G的键，实际上，如果你学习所有适当的比例和位置，你可以玩几乎任何使用标准的12音阶的音乐。

Tremolo harmonicas

Tremolo harmonicas, also sometimes referred to as “echo” harmonicas, produce their distinctive warbling sound through the use of two reeds per note, one tuned slightly sharp, the other slightly flat. The difference between the waveforms created by the paired reeds causes the beating effect that’s somewhat akin to the shimmering sound of a 12-string guitar that has paired strings tuned an octave apart.

Chromatic tremolo harmonicas are popular in Asian rock and pop music. Diatonic tremolo harps are sometimes used in folk and pop music, and produce a rustic tone that’s ideal for playing cowboy songs like “Red River Valley” around the campfire.

颤音

颤音和声，有时也被称为“回声”和声，通过使用每个音符两个簧片产生它们独特的鸣曲，一个调谐稍微锐利，另一个略微平坦。 配对簧片产生的波形之间的差异导致跳动效果，这有点类似于一个12弦吉他的闪光声音，配对琴弦调整八度音程分开。

色彩颤音和声在亚洲摇滚和流行音乐中很受欢迎。 全音阶颤音琴有时用于民间和流行音乐，并产生乡村音调，是打篝火歌曲“红河谷”等牛仔歌曲的理想选择。

Specialty harmonicas

Though far less common than the types we’ve already discussed, specialty harmonicas are popular for use in harmonica ensembles and orchestral settings. Here’s a brief overview:

Chord harmonicas

These are usually large instruments that can produce up to 48 different chords and are typically laid out in blocks of four-note clusters. Each note usually has two reeds tuned an octave apart. Chord harmonicas provide rhythmic and melodic support in harmonica ensembles.

专业调和

虽然比我们已经讨论的类型少得多，但是专业的和声很受欢迎用于口琴合奏和管弦乐设置。 这里简要概述：

和弦和声

这些通常是大型乐器，可以产生多达48种不同的和弦，并且通常布置成四音符块的块。 每个音符通常有两个芦苇调整一个八度分开。 和弦和声在口琴合奏中提供节奏和旋律支持。

Orchestral harmonicas

Also made to be played in harmonica ensembles, these come in various pitch ranges and note-layout arrangements. You’ll find both diatonic and chromatic models.

管弦乐

也制作了以口琴演奏，这些以各种音高范围和音符布局安排。 你会发现全音阶和色彩模型。

Going electric

As blues bands became increasingly electrified in the 1950s, harp players such as Little Walter began using inexpensive “bullet” microphones with crystal elements that were designed for police and taxi dispatch use. They plugged these mics into various tube guitar and bass amps, then by cupping their hands tightly around the harp and mic, produced a fat, distorted sound that has become the holy grail for Chicago-style blues tone.

Harmonica-friendly mics

The modern harmonica player has a lot of options where mics and amps are concerned. Country and acoustic blues harp players often simply play through the band’s PA system using various types of dynamic vocal mics mounted on a stand. They use their hands and head-shaking techniques to create vibrato and trill effects on sustained notes.

Electric blues and rock harp players more typically play with the the mic cupped in their hands forming a tight seal. In conjunction with their lips and mouth this creates a sound chamber that can be manipulated to create soulful, heavy tones.

As with blues and rock electric guitarists, the electric blues harp player typically seeks a punchy, distorted tone with plenty of midrange. In part this is achieved by overdriving the preamp stage of the amplifier to produce pleasing overtone-rich harmonics. The downside of this approach is that the mic is prone to pick up frequencies from PA and amp speakers, resulting in howling feedback. Experienced blues harpists combat this by keeping the harmonica tightly enclosed in their hands and avoiding stage positions that are likely to trigger feedback through the mic. Some harp mics include a volume knob that can help prevent those dreaded squeals while others, by virtue of their small size, can  easily be shielded by the player’s hands.

去电

随着蓝调乐队在20世纪50年代变得越来越电，小沃尔特之类的竖琴演奏者开始使用廉价的“子弹”麦克风和水晶元素，用于警察和出租车派遣使用。他们把这些麦克风插入各种管吉他和低音放大器，然后紧紧地他们的手紧紧地围绕竖琴和麦克风，产生了一个脂肪，扭曲的声音，已成为圣杯的芝加哥风格的蓝调。

口琴友好的话筒

现代口琴演奏者有很多选择，其中麦克风和安培。乡村和声学蓝调竖琴球员经常简单地通过乐队的PA系统使用安装在展台上的各种类型的动态语音麦克风。他们使用他们的手和摇头的技术来创建颤音和trill效果持续的笔记。

电子蓝调和摇滚竖琴演奏者更典型地与在他们的手中形成紧密密封的麦克风一起玩。与他们的嘴唇和嘴一起，这创造了一个声室，可以操纵创造灵魂，重音调。

与蓝调和摇滚电吉他手一样，电子蓝调竖琴演奏者通常寻求一种有力的，扭曲的音调与大量的中音。这部分地通过对放大器的前置放大器级进行过驱动以产生令人愉悦的泛音丰富谐波来实现。这种方法的缺点是，麦克风倾向于从PA和放大器扬声器拾取频率，导致啸声反馈。经验丰富的蓝调竖琴家通过保持口琴紧密地包围在他们的手中和避免阶段位置，可能通过麦克风触发反馈，以此来对抗这一点。一些琴键包括一个音量旋钮，可以帮助防止那些可怕的尖叫，而其他人，由于他们的小尺寸，可以很容易地被玩家的手遮蔽。

Harmonica-friendly amplifiers

Back in the day, harp players used whatever amps were available—typically small tube amps intended for guitar. The larger Fender assmaBn Combo with its four 10” speakers was also a popular choice since it generates plenty of punchy volume to compete with drums and heavily amplified guitars and is sensitive to playing dynamics. (More on this killer combo in a minute.)

Today, things haven’t changed too much. Most harp players still look to smaller tube guitar combo amps to generate the sounds they love. In larger venues, they usually close-mic their combo’s speaker(s) sending the signal to the PA system via the mixing console.

Here are some of the more popular amp choices:

The affordable Hohner Hoodoo Box is a 5W amp that makes a good starter amp for the player just getting into amplified harp. Powered by an EL84 tube with 12AX3 and 12AU7 tubes in the preamp, it develops a surprising amount of volume through its 8” Celestion speaker and has a spring reverb—a nice feature for adding excitement to your solos.

谐波放大器

回到当天，竖琴演奏者使用任何可用的放大器 - 通常是用于吉他的小管放大器。更大的Fender assmaBn组合及其四个10“扬声器也是一个受欢迎的选择，因为它产生大量的冲击音量来与鼓和大放大的吉他竞争，并对游戏动态敏感。 （更多关于这个杀手组合在一分钟。）

今天，事情没有改变太多。大多数竖琴演奏者仍然期待更小的管吉他组合放大器产生他们喜欢的声音。在较大的场所，他们通常通过混音控制台关闭他们的组合扬声器发送信号到PA系统。

下面是一些更流行的音箱选择：

经济实惠的Hohner Hoodoo Box是一个5W的放大器，使一个很好的启动放大器的播放器只是进入放大的竖琴。由前置放大器中的12AX3和12AU7管构成的EL84管，它通过其8“Celestion扬声器开发出惊人的音量，并有一个弹簧混响 - 一个很好的功能，为你的独奏增添兴奋。

The Fender Super-Champ X2 Guitar Combo Amp has a 15W power stage that gets really loud, and when overdriven produces the harmonically rich distortion that’s ideal for creating the towering “Mississippi saxophone” sound pioneered by artists like Little Walter Jacobs and Big Walter Horton. It’s very portable, and can be easily miked when playing in larger venues.

If you’re looking for more power and have a bigger budget, the Fender 65 Princeton Reverb is an authentic re-creation of the original beloved by both harp players and guitarists for decades. It’s equipped with three 12AX7 tubes and a 12AT7 in the preamp, dual Groove Tubes 6V6s in the power stage, and a single 5AR4 rectifier tube that together with the 10” Jensen speaker pour out retro “blackface” tone.

As mentioned above, The Fender Fender Vintage Reissue '59 Bassman Combo is a popular choice with harp players looking for the best in fat harmonica tone at volume levels that don’t require close-miking the cabinet. Cranking out a huge 50W via improved USA-made GT-6L6 output tubes, it has a biasing pot enabling tone tweakers to experiment with other tubes. (Some harp pros switch out the 12AX7 preamp tubes for lower-gain tubes such as the 12AY7 and 12AU7, which can help curb feedback problems.)

Fender超级冠军X2吉他组合音箱有一个15W的功率级，得到真正响亮，当过载产生谐波丰富的失真，是创建由Little Walter Jacobs和Big Walter Horton等艺术家率先开发的高耸“密西西比萨克斯”声音的理想选择。它非常便携，当在较大的场地玩时可以很容易地迷路。

如果你正在寻找更多的权力和更大的预算，Fender 65普林斯顿混响是一个真正的重新创作的原始心爱的竖琴球员和吉他手几十年。它配备了前置放大器中的三个12AX7管和一个12AT7，功率级的双槽管6V6，以及一个单独的5AR4整流管，与10“Jensen扬声器一起播放复古的”黑色“音调。

如上所述，Fender Fender Vintage Reissue '59 Bassman Combo是一个受欢迎的选择，竖琴球员正在寻找最好的脂肪口琴，音量级别不需要靠近内阁。通过改进的美国制造的GT-6L6输出管起动一个巨大的50W，它有一个偏置锅，使色调调整试验其他管。 （一些竖琴人开关12AX7前置放大器管用于低增益管，如12AY7和12AU7，这有助于抑制反馈问题。）

While most electric blues harp players don’t use a lot of effects, reverb is one popular effect that can add a lot of drama to the sound of the harmonica. A built-in reverb, especially an authentic spring or plate-type reverb tank is considered a worthy feature by many harpists. If your amp doesn’t have reverb, you can always use an external reverb stompbox giving you the advantage of hands-free control.
